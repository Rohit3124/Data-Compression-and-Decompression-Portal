# File Compression and Decompression Web Application

## Description

This web application enables users to upload files and apply various data compression algorithmsâ€”including **Huffman Coding**, **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, and **LZ77**â€”to reduce file size efficiently. Users can also decompress previously compressed files using the corresponding algorithms.

The application offers a simple and interactive interface where users can:

- Upload files for compression
- Select a preferred compression algorithm
- View and compare compression ratios to evaluate algorithm efficiency
- Download the compressed or decompressed files

By supporting multiple algorithms and showing comparative results, the system provides educational insight into the performance of different compression techniques.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/Rohit3124/Data-Compression-and-Decompression-Portal.git
   cd Data-Compression-and-Decompression-Portal

2. Install Dependencie
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ../frontend
   npm install

3. Setup Environment Variables
   Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URL=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>

4. Run the Frontend
   From the root directory try running
   cd frontend
   npm run dev

5. Run the Backend
   From the root directory try running
   cd backend
   nodemon index.js

The server should start and display:
Connected to MongoDB...
Listening on port 3000...

Basic API Endpoints
â€¢ POST /api/user/signup -Register a new user
â€¢ POST /api/auth/signin -Login user
â€¢ POST /api/file/process -To compress/decompress file

Notes
â€¢ Ensure the .env file is correctly set up before running the application.
â€¢ Modify PORT in .env if needed.
â€¢ If facing MongoDB connection issues, verify MONGODB_URL is correctly set.
